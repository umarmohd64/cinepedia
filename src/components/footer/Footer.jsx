                This web-application has been made solely by me. I have employed the use of <b><em>React.js</em></b> for managing front-end of this project.
                In order to manage the states and UI, <b><em>Redux, and Redux-Toolkit </em></b> have been used.
                Also, this project utilizes a good implication of <b><em>SCSS</em></b> as the styling framework to make it super-responsive for all devices.
                I have taken the data of various movies, and TV shows as well as people from the TMDB website and respective <b><em>API calls</em></b> have been made in order to display and manage the same. 
                Firstly, a proper environment was made including base URLs and tokens and further API calling was done according to the requirements. <br />
                I have tried to cover some additional and core concepts of React.js such as <em>JSX, props, states,  props, various hooks</em>  as well as <em>conditional rendering and components' lifecycle</em> to build a proper user-interface. <br />
                <em>P.S.: I have made the logo myself</em> <br /><br />

                Thank you for choosing <em> <b>Cinepedia</b></em> , your ultimate destination for all things movies and TV shows! <br />
                Lights, camera, action - let the movie journey begin!
